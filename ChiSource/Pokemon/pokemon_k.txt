*AUTHOR'S NOTE*
Now the Pokemon FAQ is finally completed, but I'm still adding some more 
things to it! And you will still need to ask me if you want to use the 
FAQ on your website. Since I am getting some Pokemon questions and the 
answers are right in the FAQ, I will ignore the question. It's starting 
to tick me off that people can't even search for the answers when it's 
right in front of their faces! But if you have a question whose answer is 
not in the FAQ, e-mail me.

===================
2) PLAYING POKEMON
===================
This section explains on playing the game and gives some tips.

What's the difference between the Red and Blue Versions?
Everything is the same except it may have a Pokemon in one version but 
not in the other. For example, you can find a Ekans in the Red Version, 
but you can't find in the Blue. Instead, the Blue Version contains a 
Sandshrew. So, you need to find a friend who has the other version to get 
all 150. In order to trade, you need a Game Link Cable (Sold seperately). 
When you find someone, you can trade Pokemon!

How do I capture Pokemon?
First off, you need to purchase some Poke Balls at a Poke Mart. Each kind 
of ball can perform better or worse than others. Then visit a cave or an 
area with grass. There are some another places, but you see those the 
most. Walk around until you go into battle. Have your Pokemon fight the 
enemy until the enemy's energy level is very low. Use your Poke Ball, and 
you should be able to capture one. If not, keep trying! And remember you 
cannot capture a trainer's Pokemon!

I captured one, now what do I do?
Now you can train your Pokemon to fight! Remember, to heal your Pokemon, 
just visit a Pokemon Center. Also once you capture one, data is recorded 
in your PokeDex. With that, you can find some info and where you can find 
it. I won't go into much more detail because other parts of this section 
explain them.

How do my Pokemon learn moves?
You can get them in one of two ways. Once Pokemon reach a certain level 
they learn a move. Another way is to use a TM or HM on it. Moves use 
Power Points (PP). So when you don't have any PP, the Pokemon can't use 
the move until healed. Remember that your Pokemon can only have four 
moves at a time!

What do these "types" mean?
Every Pokemon has one or two types out of fifteen. They tell how your 
Pokemon will perform against other types. Look in your manual to find the 
Battle Chart. For example, a Grass-type does great against a Water-type, 
but it does poor against a Fire-type.

How do I build levels?
If you played an RPG before, you should understand know how it works. 
First, find an area like I said about before for capturing, or you can 
fight trainers. Go into battle, and if your Pokemon wins, it gains EXP. 
Once it gets a certain amount of EXP, it goes up a level. With a level-
up, its stats increases. To see how much is needed, check its stats. If 
you switch Pokemon in battle, they both get EXP, but the amount is 
reduced. That can also help when you want to build your low-level 
Pokemon.

What are the Technical Machines (TMs) and Hidden Machines (HMs) for?
These items can teach your Pokemon new moves for battle, but they work a 
bit differently. TMs can only be used once and only work in battle. HMs 
can be used over and over, and the moves work on the Field Map and 
battle. Most moves can only work with certain Pokemon, such as "Fly" only 
works with Flying-type.

How do my Pokemon evolve?
Some Pokemon may evolve a couple times or some may not evolve at all! 
When they evolve, the Pokemon's stats increase more than a level-up 
would. Pokemon can in one of three ways:
#1: Level-Up 
This one is used more than the others. The Pokemon changes once it 
reaches a certain level. For example, Kakuna evolves into Beedrill at 
around Level 10.
#2: Item
Some Pokemon only evolve if you use a certain Stone. Most Stones can be 
bought at Celadon City. For example, Staryu evolves into Starmie if you 
use a Water Stone on it.
#3: Trade
These Pokemon only evolve if you trade with a friend who has another Game 
Pak. This applies to four Pokemon. For example, Graveler evolves into 
Golem when traded.

How do I earn money?
There are two ways to do this. You can fight a trainer and win or use the 
"Pay Day" attack. You can get Pay Day from Meowth or from a TM on Route 
12.

A Few Tips:
- Use strategy! Using it will make Pokemon MUCH easier!
- Build levels whenever possible and try to build them evenly.
- If you carry six Pokemon, capture another one and automatically goes to 
the PC!
- Trade often for new Pokemon!
- When you use traded Pokemon, they gain about 1/2 more EXP than a 
regular Pokemon!
- When a Pokemon evolves, its stats increase more than a normal level-up 
would. Also its type may change after evolving.
- Fight trainers when you can to earn more money.
- Search trees, rocks, etc. for some free items. You usually find them if 
it is in a "strange" place such as being in the middle of nowhere.
- If you use Poison-type Pokemon, you won't need to worry about being 
poisoned!
- In both Versions, there are five Pokemon (Snorlax, Zapdos, Articuno, 
Moltres, and Mewtwo) that appear once (Snorlax appears twice). So 
capturing them will be a good addition to your collection!

==================
3) IMPORTANT INFO
==================
This section includes info on HMs, TMs, Moon Stone Locations, Cable Club, 
Exchange Corner, Fishing, Safari Zone, and the Elite Four/Gary!

---------------
Hidden Machines
---------------

HM 01 - Cut:
In order for you to get the HM 01, you must first get the S.S. Ticket. Go 
to Route 24 and 25 and visit Bill the Pokemanic. Bill had a bizarre 
accident with a new experimental machine. Talk to him, and he goes into 
the machine. Use the PC, and Bill will be changed back to normal. He will 
give you the ticket as a reward. Visit Vermilion City and board the S.S. 
Anne. Work your way around the ship until you fight Gary. Beat Gary and 
go down the stairs to enter the captain's room. Talk to him and "rub" his 
back to get the HM. The Cut ability allows you to cut down trees to 
access other areas.

HM 02 - Fly: 
This one is not that hard to get. Go to Route 16 west of Celadon City. 
Cut down the tree and follow the road into a building. Keep going west 
and enter the house. The person inside will give you the HM. The Fly 
ability allows you to visit cities you've been to. 

HM 03 - Surf:
This one is located in the Secret House in Safari Zone. I can't really 
explain this well, so just try to make your way around. Once you reach 
the house, the man inside gives you the HM as a prize. The Surf ability 
allows you to move around on water. 

HM 04 - Strength:
The Warden in Fuchsia City will give you the HM if you give him his Gold 
Teeth. The teeth are located in Safari Zone. It's in Area 3 near the 
Secret House. Get them and give them to the Warden. Now that he can talk, 
he'll hand over the Hidden Machine. The Strength ability allows you to 
move heavy boulders.

HM 05 - Flash:
Enter Diglett's Cave east of Vermilion City. Go through to get near 
Viridian Forest. The one house in that section is where one of Prof. 
Oak's aides is. If you caught 10 or more kinds of Pokemon, he gives you 
HM 05.

Right when you enter the Mansion, they are boxes to the left and right of 
you. Search around the fifth box on the right to find the Moon Stone. 

----------
Cable Club
----------
Here's some information for the Cable Club. This isn't a very big section 
since there is not much to the Cable Club.

- Intro -
Incase if you have no idea what the Cable Club is, you can trade or fight 
your Pokemon with a friend's. But in order to do so, you must purchase a 
Game Link Cable (It's not very expensive). Once you have one, insert the 
end of the Cable in the "EXT. CONNECTOR" slot on the Game Boys. Then 
start your games up, and go to a Pokemon Center. Talk to the person at 
the entrance of the Cable Club at the same time on both games. You can 
then choose to go to the Colosseum or the Trade Center...   

- Colosseum -
Here you can fight your friend! Before you enter the Cable Club, make 
sure you choose the Pokemon you want to fight with because you won't be 
able switch in the Cable Club! With your Pokemon, turn the PC on to begin 
the fight. Not that much to say about this, but remember that this battle 
will take longer since you have to wait the data to transfer between the 
two Game Boys.

- Trade Center -  
Here you can trade Pokemon between you and your friend! Remember that you 
can only trade Pokemon, you can't just give them away (Though it would be 
nice)! Here's how to trade. Turn on the PC and a screen will come up 
showing you and your friend's current Pokemon. Both of you select the 
Pokemon you want to trade. Then it will show the Pokemon being 
transferred. Now the Pokemon that was traded will be able to get 
"boosted" EXP. Here's something good that you can use to your advantage. 
When you trade a Pokemon, your Pokedex will still count the Pokemon that 
was traded as "caught". For example, if you trade a Scyther for a Pinsir, 
your Pokedex will still count as you having a Scyther! That can be very 
useful when going for all of the Pokemon.

---------------
Exchange Corner
---------------
At Exchange Corner in Celadon City, you trade Coins for some Pokemon and 
TMs. In order to get the Coins, you win or buy them at Game Corner. But 
you need a Coin Case to hold them. Near Exchange Corner, there is a 
diner, and a man inside will give you the case. With that, go back to 
Game Corner. Talk to the people inside for some Coins. Now you can play 
the slots, or you can buy 50 Coins for $1000. Each slot machine has 
different odds of winning, so if you find a good one, stick to it! What 
you can get is a bit different in the Versions. Since the price varies, 
the person with the cheaper Pokemon should get it. For example, it's a 
good idea to have the person with the Blue Version to get Porygon rather 
than Red because there is a 3,499 C difference! Here is what you can get:

Fishing
-------
(This section was submitted by: MLW65128TX, additional Pokemon locations 
by: DZY351378)

Fishing is the way of catching Water-type Pokemon, but the rods seem to 
catch different Pokemon, here's more:

Old Rod - Don't expect much, just a Magikarp will bite it, but if you 
train it to Level 20, it will turn into Gyarados, a dragon (NOT a Dragon-
type) and a tough Pokemon.

Good Rod - Can catch a Goldeen, Magikarp, and Poliwag but the only way to 
catch the best is the Super Rod.

Super Rod - The best rod and can catch ALL of the pokemon in the water.

People usually don't know what Pokemon are in a piece of water when you 
use the Super Rod. But here's what you can get:

Pallet Town - Tentacool & Poliwag

Viridian City - Tentacool & Poliwag

Cerulean City - Goldeen, Psyduck, & Krabby

Vermilion City - Krabby & Shellder

Celadon City - Slowpoke & Poliwhirl

Fuchsia City - Krabby, Goldeen, Magikarp, & Seaking 

Route 22 - Poliwag & Goldeen

Route 4, 24 & 25 - Same as Cerulean City

Route 6 & 11 - Same as Vermilion City

Route 10 - Same as Celadon City

Routes 12, 13, 17, & 18 - Tentacool, Krabby, Goldeen, & Magikarp

Route 19 - Shellder, Goldeen, Tentacool, Staryu, & Horsea

Safari Zone - Psyduck, Krabby, Slowpoke, & Dratini
                                                             
--------------------------
Safari Zone (Fuchsia City)
--------------------------
For a low price of $500, you can capture all the Pokemon you want! Here's 
a rundown of how Safari Zone works. When you pay, you can 30 Safari Balls 
and Bait. 30 Balls may seem a lot, but you'll end up using most of them. 
You have four areas to explore, each may have a Pokemon that is not in 
the other. You also have a timer, but it only decreases when you walk. 
When you run out of time or Balls, the game is over. The battle system in 
this mini-game works different than a regular battle. Instead of having 
Pokemon fight, you fight...sort of. In otherwords, you can't cause ANY 
damage to the enemy, that's why they give you 30 Balls! You have four 
commands in battle: 

Ball x(Amount of Balls) - Throws a Safari Ball. You usually have to throw 
multiple times to capture a Pokemon.
Bait - Throw some Bait. This makes it slightly easier to capture.
Throw Rock - Throw a nearby rock. Makes it slightly easier to capture, 
but the Pokemon tends to run away after you use this.
Run - Ummm...pretty much self-explanatory... :)

Here's a list of Pokemon you can capture in Safari Zone:

#29 Nidoran (F)
#30 Nidorina
#32 Nidoran (M)
#33 Nidorino
#48 Venonat
#49 Venomoth
#54 Psyduck
#79 Slowpoke
#84 Doduo
#98 Krabby
#102 Exeggcute
#111 Rhyhorn
#113 Chansey
#115 Kangaskhan
#123 Scyther
#127 Pinsir
#128 Tauros
#147 Dratini

Here's a trick you can do to fight Pokemon in the Safari Zone outside of 
it. Enter the Safari Zone, exit and go to the eastern side of Seafoam 
Islands. Move up and down along the "shore" part to fight Pokemon from 
the Safari Zone! This makes it easier to capture them. The bad part is 
that there are some Pokemon that you won't find.

Elite Four/Gary
---------------

Elite Four:
(This section was submitted by: MLW65128TX, corrections made by: RobertR)

****************************************************************
ROUND #1

TRAINER: Lorelei
POKEMON: Dewgong - L54, Cloyster - L53, Slowbro - L54, Jynx - L56, Lapras 
- L56

Lorelei is the Mistress of Ice Pokemon. This is the easiest one because 
Fire, Fighting, and Electric are the ones that have advanteges. Ghost 
Pokemon will have an advantage over Jynx.
****************************************************************

****************************************************************
ROUND #2

TRAINER: Bruno
POKEMON: Onix - L53, Hitmonchan - L55, Hitmonlee - L55, Onix - L56, 
Machamp - L58

Bruno is a Fighting-type Pokemon master and also tougher. Flying, Ghost, 
and Psychic Pokemon have the advantage on this one. 
****************************************************************

NOTE:At this point, if your pokemon are in good shape, go on but then 
there's NO GOING BACK!

****************************************************************
ROUND #3

TRAINER: Agatha
POKEMON: Gengar - L56, Golbat - L56, Haunter - L55, Arbok - L58, Gengar - 
L60

Agatha is the master of Ghost-type pokemon and has a very sneaky way of 
Fighting, but Water and Fire have a good chance. She is also a tad 
weaker, so be relaxed. (My Note: Enough though Agatha may be weaker than 
the others, few attacks will hit her Ghost Pokemon!)
****************************************************************

Now, make sure you heal your Pokemon with any type of Potions if you have 
any. I miraculously beat the next guy, but here he is, the leader.

****************************************************************
ROUND #4

TRAINER: Lance
POKEMON: Gyarados - L58, Dragonair - L56, Dragonair - L56, Aerodactyl - 
L60, Dragonite - L62

Lance is the leader and the toughest fighter you have seen at all times, 
he has Dragon-type pokemon. Ice, Psychic, Flying, and Ghost Pokemon have 
an advantage. 
****************************************************************

If you beat him, you're a Pokemon Master now! Congrats! But you got 
someone else to fight...

Gary:
(This section was submitted by: cfetters)

You've beaten the Elite Four? All right! Now you are the Pok‚mon League 
Champion! Or, at least you would be, but you have one more challenge 
ahead. Gary is the real Pokemon League Champion!

****************************************************************
TRAINER: Gary
POKEMON: Pidgeot, Alakazam, & Rhydon. His other Pokemon varies, so here 
is what you may be up against...

Chose Charmander: Exeggutor, Gyrados, & Charizard.
Chose Squirtle: Exeggcutor, Arcanine, & Blastoise.
Chose Bulbasaur: Arcanine, Gyrados, & Venusaur.

Here's how to beat the Pokemon:

Pigeot - Use any Electric-type Pokemon.

Alakazam - Use Jolteon or a Psychic-type Pokemon.

Rhydon - Use a Water-type or a Grass-type Pokemon.

Exeggutor/Venusaur - Use a Fire-type Pokemon.

Arcanine/Charizard - Use a Water-type. (My Note: A Rock-type Pokemon will 
also do well against them.)

Gyrados/Blastoise - Like Pidgeot, an Electric-type will defeat them 
easily.
****************************************************************

Now with Gary out of the way, you can explore the cave near Cerulean 
City!

===================
4) POKEMON PIKACHU
===================

- Introduction -
If you've used a Giga Pet or Tamagotchi, you probably know how to take 
care of virtual pets. The newly released Pokemon Pikachu is very 
different from a Giga Pet. Pikachu doesn't rely on you to do everything 
for him...you just play with him! When you play with him, you gain 
points. The more you have, the more he likes you. You can gain points by 
walking with him, shaking him, and giving him Watts. So what's really 
nice about this is that Pikachu doesn't really require 24 hour care!

- Starting Out -
When you first get your Pokemon Pikachu, pull out the tab to start 
Pikachu up. Then press the A button when the "Clock" symbol is 
highlighted to set the time. Use Up or Down on the Control Pad to set the 
hour. Press A to set the minutes. Press A again to start to care of your 
pet.

- Game Screens - 
Here's some info on the Game Screens on Pokemon Pikachu. 

Clock: Here you can set the Alarm. To set it, do the same thing for 
setting the time. If you're wondering, this is not required to wake 
Pikachu up.
Present: Here you can give Pikachu Watts as gifts. You can give him only 
up to 999 Watts at a time. 
Coins: Here you can play the Slot Machine to win Watts. Check the 
"Earning Watts" part for more information. 
Friend-Status: Press the Select button to access this. It tells you how 
Pikachu is doing with you along with his total Points.

- Options Menu -
Press Start to access this menu. Here's what you can do...

Reset: This resets the Points on the Main Screen. This does not reset the 
total amount of Points you've earned!
Sound: Allows you to turn the sound on or off.
Time Set: Allows you to change the time. See the "Starting Out" part to 
see how to set the time.

- Earning Points -  
Like I mentioned before, points will build up your friendship with 
Pikachu. Earning them is easy, but you'll need to do a good bit of work 
to get tons of them! Here's how you can earn some points. When you shake 
Pikachu, you can hear something moving inside. Each time you hear this 
sound, Pikachu gains a point. You can also do that when you walk with 
him. If you shake him long enough, he will start to walk while saying 
"Pikachu". Shake him even longer and he will start to run or ride a 
bicycle.

- Earning Watts -
Giving Watts to Pikachu as a gift will make him do something special. 
There are two ways to gain Watts. If you shake or walk with him, you can 
gain some Watts. You get about five Watts for every 100 points. You also 
get some by playing the Mini-Game Slot Machine. Here, you bet five Watts 
to gain some more. If you can learn the timing to this game, earning them 
will be very easy. Here's what you can get:

3 Sevens (7) - 500 Watts
3 Cat Heads - 50 Watts
3 Flowers - 30 Watts
3 Fish - 30 Watts

Once you earn over a 1,000 Watts, I would keep the 1,000 in reserve and 
give Pikachu any over a thousand. Later on, you can increase the minimum 
amount of Watts to keep.

- Pikachu's Actions -
Here's a small list of what Pikachu will do while you take care of him 
and what happens when you shake him while he does an action.

Brushing His Teeth - He brushes faster.
Playing At The Beach - He shovels faster.
Weight Lifting - He drops the weight.
Building With Blocks - A block drops off his small building.
Sleeping - He wakes up.
Spinning Around - His ears "perk" up, and he'll start looking at you.
Adding 9+2 - Has a question mark over his head.
Licking ice cream cone -  He drops the cone on the floor
Licking lollipop - He drops it on the floor.
Watching TV - He jumps up and down.
Taking a bath - He bobs his head back and forth.
While he "Loves" you and is standing - He waves his arms in glee.
Swims, hang-glides, plays a piano, plays a trumpet and balance on a ball.
Rides a motorcycle.
Rides a sports car when he "Loves" you.

- Actions From Watts -
Here is what Pikachu will do if you give him a certain number of Watts as 
a Gift:

999 Watts - Swims, hang-glides, plays a piano, plays a trumpet, and 
balances on a ball.

500 Watts - Executes a backflip.

200- Watts - Yawns.

- Pikachu Tips -

Easy Watts
By: FiveOne4Up (Michael Lucas)
If you play the Slots after you get 10,000 Points, you will get 3 Seven 
(7)'s no matter what (Unless you end up timing it horribly).  This will 
almost double the points you get per Step.

6) F. A. Q.
============
Before you e-mail me a Pokemon question, read this section to see if your 
question will be already answered!

Q: When is the Yellow Version of Pokemon coming to the U.S.?
A: The Yellow Version is confirmed to be released in the States, but 
there is no release date set. It might be here later this year. On 
Nintendo's official site, Pokemon Yellow is listed as a "Future Game".

Q: What's the most effective way to use the Vitamins?
A: If you're desperate, use them as soon as possible, but if you want the 
full effect, do this. Remember that a Pokemon can take about 10 Vitamins 
before it work anymore on it. It seems that a Pokemon with a much higher 
Level, gains more stat points if you use a Vitamin on it. For example, a 
Pokemon at L10 will only gain 1 stat point for each Vitamin used which 
would mean it would gain 10 points for 10 Vitamins. But if you use one on 
a L100 Pokemon, it would gain a whopping 40 stat points! So my point here 
is this, use the Vitamins on a Pokemon when you have trained as far as 
you can.

Q: What is the use of a PP Up?
A: It's purpose is to increase the PP of an ability of a Pokemon. You can 
use a maximum of three PP Ups per ability. But the PP increased will vary 
so here's how it works. The ability that has a low max PP will not 
increase very much, but an ability with a high max PP will. For example, 
if you use 3 PP Up on Tackle, its max will become 56 from 35. If you use 
it on Hyper Beam, its max will become 8 from 5.

Q: Some of the Pokemon never evolve no matter what the Stones or the 
Level, how do I evolve them? 
A: They evolve by trading the Pokemon to another GamePak.

Q: How do I stop my Pokemon from evolving?
A:: Once it starts to evolve, simply press B to cancel the process. Once 
the Pokemon gains another Level, it'll try to evolve again.

Q: What's the difference between the Red Version and the Blue?
A: The only difference is that they both contain Pokemon that cannot be 
found in the other. Here's a list of the Pokemon (Note that some of these 
can only be evolved by Stones!):

Red Version: Ekans, Arbok, Electabuzz, Growlithe, Arcanine, Mankey, 
Primeape, Oddish, Gloom, Vileplume, Scyther.

Blue Version: Sandshrew, Sandslash, Magmar, Vulpix, Ninetales, Meowth, 
Persian, Bellsprout, Weepinbell, Victreebell, Pinsir.

Q: What does "Area Unknown" in the Pokedex mean?
A: It means that that Pokemon can only be evolved from another Pokemon or 
it can mean that the Pokemon can only be found in the other Version.

Q: What's the difference between Boosted EXP and Regular EXP?
A: Boosted EXP allows a Pokemon to gain about 1/2 more EXP than a Pokemon 
with Regular EXP. The downside with Boosted EXP is that the Pokemon will 
become weaker.: Why does my Pokemon not obey me?
A: You must get the Badge that allows you to command a higher level 
Pokemon!

Q: What do you get for capturing all 150 Pokemon?
A: A man in Celadon City will give you a Diploma in the U.S. Version. If 
you do this with the Japanese Version, you'd get the Pokemon, Mew!

Q: Where do I find the Poke Flute?
A: Read the Walkthrough!

Q: I've defeated [Insert Gym Leader here], and they say I can use [Insert 
HM Ability here]. How do I use it?
A: The Badge you get from winning only "allows" you to use the ability 
once you have found the HM! For example, Lt. Surge says that you can use 
"Fly", but you must first get HM 02 west of Celadon City. Then teach it 
to a Pokemon.

Q: I have the HM, but the ability won't work!
A: You must earn the Badge that allows you to use it!

Q: How many Masterballs are in the game?
A: Only one, so use it on a one-time Pokemon like Mewtwo.

Q: If I defeat the rare Pokemon (Articuno, Zapdos, Moltres, Snorlax, 
Mewtwo) is there any other way to get them?
A: No, so once you defeat one, it's gone for good! 

Q: How can I earn some money?
A: There's a couple ways for this. One way is to defeat Trainers, and 
also fighting the Elite Four over and over makes getting money easy. Get 
a Meowth and use its Pay Day attack. And finally, get TM 16 which is at 
Route 12 and teach Pay Day to a Pokemon.

Q: Is there any other way to get Mew without cheating?
A: Yes, but there's only one way. You must enter Nintendo's contest from 
the Nintendo Power magazine. 

Q: How do I reach the Card Key in Silph. Co?
A: To reach it, step on the Warp Tile near the Rocket guard. Then when 
you reappear, step on it again. Now you can go past the guard to the Card 
Key!

Q: How can I move the truck near the S.S. Anne with Strength?
A: You can't, I've tried it before!

Q: I have read about [Insert rumor here]. Is the rumor true?
A: There's a 99.9% chance that it's false. But if you want, e-mail me the 
rumor, and I'll try it out and put it up on the FAQ.

Q: I've heard that there are other Pokemon in the Red/Blue Versions of 
the game, such as Topegy and Pikablu. Is this true?
A: No, those Pokemon are in the Gold & Silver Versions. 

Q: Is Gameboy Color's IR Connection compatible with Pokemon?
A: No, so you have to buy a Game Link Cable in order to trade.

Q: How long is your FAQ?
A: About 100+ pages! I would print this after I make the FINAL update.

===============
7) WALKTHROUGH
===============
NOTE: This walkthrough may not contain every little secret, but tells the 
basic things that you need to know to complete the game.

When start a new game, Professor Oak will tell you about Pokemon. Then 
you choose your name and your rival's name. I'll refer your rival as Gary 
since that is really what his name is. Now on to the game...

-----------
Pallet Town
-----------
Pokemon:
#1 Bulbasaur,
#4 Charmander, or
#7 Squirtle

You appear in your house when you start. Go out of the house and try to 
head north. Prof. Oak stops you and takes you back to his lab. When you 
get there, you and Gary must choose one of his three Pokemon: Charmander, 
Squirtle, or Bulbasaur. Since you can't get these anywhere else, you may 
to get your friend with the other Version to get all three. If you don't 
want to, just choose Bulbasaur. If you want all three here's the method 
to do so:
1. Have Gameboy A start a new game.
2. Gameboy A chooses a Pokemon.
3. Go to Viridian City, get Oak's Parcel and deliver it to him in Pallet 
Town.
4. Go back to Viridian City and go to the Cable Club.
5. Gameboy A trades the Pokemon for one of Gameboy B's. Make sure that 
Gameboy B chooses a Pokemon that he doesn't need because you'll lose it.
6. Gameboy A starts a new game and chooses a Pokemon.
7. Keep repeating until Gameboy B has two Charmanders, Squirtles, and 
Bulbsaurs. Or just five since Gameboy B already has one.
8. After all that, trade your Pokemon until Gameboy A and B both have a 
Charmander, Squirtle, and Bulbasaur. 
Once you have done that, Gary chooses one. Have you ever noticed that 
whatever he chooses, it's in his favor? Anyway, he then challenges you to 
a duel. It doesn't really matter if you win, you just get $175 for it. 
Now head north to Route 1.

-------
Route 1
-------
Pokemon:
#16 Pidgey
#19 Rattata

Not that much to do here. You might as well just build your levels by one 
or two since you can't capture yet. Keep heading north to Viridian City. 

-------------
Viridian City
-------------
Items:
Oak's Parcel
Pokedex

This is the first place with a Pokemon Center and a Poke Mart. When you 
first enter, head to the Poke Mart. The clerk inside gives you Oak's 
Parcel. Head back to Pallet Town and deliver it to Oak. Once you deliver 
it, he gives Gary and you a Pokedex which records data on Pokemon you've 
seen or captured. After that, head back to Viridian City and buy some 
Poke Balls at the Poke Mart. Go to Route 1 and capture a Pidgey and 
Rattata. If want to capture more Pokemon, buy some more Poke Balls. Go to 
the west to Route 22 where you can fight Gary, but it's optional. You can 
capture a Nidoran (M) or a Nidoran (F) here. If you want the Town Map, 
head back to Pallet Town and get it from Gary's sister. Now head to Route 
2, north of Viridian City. 

-------
Route 2
-------
Pokemon:
#10 Caterpie
#13 Weedle
#16 Pidgey
#19 Rattata

Again, not a whole lot to do! You can find a Weedle in Red Version, but 
the Caterpie in the Blue in this area. This shows that may find a Pokemon 
in one Version, but not in the other. But it only applies to this area, 
so you can find it in both Versions in other places. Anyway, capture one 
and head north to Viridian Forest.

---------------
Viridian Forest
---------------
Pokemon:
#10 Caterpie
#11 Metapod
#13 Weedle
#14 Kakuna
#25 Pikachu

Items:
Poke Ball
Antidote 
Potion

They is actually a bit of things to do here. Now is a good time to build 
your levels to around nine if you can. Here's how to navigate this place. 
Note that this is from your perspective on the screen, not the 
character's! From the start, go left, up, left to reach the Poke Ball. Go 
back to the start and go right, up to reach the Antidote. You encounter 
two Bug Catchers as you go up. From there, go left, down and follow the 
path to the last trainer. From the trainer, go down, right, down to the 
reach the Potion. Go back to where the trainer is and go up to Pewter 
City. 

-----------
Pewter City
-----------
This city contains the first Pokemon League trainer, Brock. If you visit 
the Museum for a cost of $50, you can see fossils of rare extinct 
Pokemon. Later on in the game you'll be able to revive some of them, but 
don't get too excited. You can't go to Route 3 to the east until you beat 
Brock so now enter the Gym...

****************************************************************
TRAINER: Brock
PRIZES: Boulder Badge & TM 34
POKEMON: Geodude - L12, Onix - L14

Before you fight Brock, there is another trainer, but you can avoid him 
if you walk behind him. Talk to Brock at the end of the Gym to fight. 
This guy is super easy as long as you have a Squirtle and/or a Bulbasaur 
at about level 13. If you use Charmander, you will a tough time fighting. 
For Squirtle, use Bubble, and for Bulbasaur, use Vine Whip. With those 
techniques, you should be able to beat the Pokemon with a hit or two. 
****************************************************************

Once you've beaten him, you can now head to Route 3. 

-------
Route 3
-------
Pokemon:
#16 Pidgey
#19 Rattata
#21 Spearow
#39 Jigglypuff
#129 Magikarp

You can encounter several trainers here. The only new Pokemon to get is 
Spearow and Jigglypuff. So capture them and keep going until you reach 
the Pokemon Center. Here is a salesman who will sell you a $500 Magikarp. 
You don't need to get him now since you fish for him later, but you can 
if you want. Go right to get to the entrance to Mt. Moon.

--------
Mt. Moon
--------
Pokemon:
#35 Clefairy
#41 Zubat
#46 Paras
#74 Geodude

Items:
Potion x2
Escape Rope
Moon Stone
HP Up
Rare Candy
TM 01
TM 12

As you can see, this place is loaded with Pokemon and items. A definite 
catch is Geodude in my opinion since he works well when fighting mostly 
any Pokemon. It's a good idea to explore and find all these items since 
they can be very useful. If you just want to get out, here's how you do 
it. From the start, go up, right, up, right, up, left, down (Avoid the 
ladder!), left, up, and go down the ladder. Follow the path and go down 
the ladder at the end. The rest of the way is pretty much straight-
forward, so keep going and beat the Rocket guard. Go past him to fight 
again. Defeat him, and he will let you choose a Dome or a Helix Fossil. 
If you know someone with another Version, have that person get one Fossil 
and you get the other. Later on, you can revive them and trade them. 
After that, keep going until you get out at Route 4. 

-------
Route 4
-------
Pokemon:
#16 Pidgey
#19 Rattata
#21 Spearow
#23 Ekans (Red)
#27 Sandshrew (Blue)

Items:
TM 04

Get the Pokemon that's in your Version, get the TM and go east to 
Cerulean City.

-------------
Cerulean City
-------------
For now, just rest and buy supplies since you are trapped in here. This 
city contains the Bike Shop where you can buy...a bike! :) The cost? A 
mere $1,000,000! Don't worry, you can get one for free a little bit 
later. Now we can fight the Gym Leader, Misty...

****************************************************************
TRAINER: Misty
PRIZES: Cascade Badge & TM 11
POKEMON: Staryu - L18, Starmie - L21

Another easy match! Use Bulbasaur (It probably evolved by now) or a 
Pikachu with a level at about 17. Then just use Grass- or Electric-type 
attacks on them. This battle shouldn't take very long...
****************************************************************

With Misty defeated you should now head north to the Nugget Bridge. Here, 
you fight five Trainers to get a Nugget. Before you get a chance to fight 
them, you must fight Gary... 

****************************************************************
TRAINER: Gary
POKEMON: Pidgeotto - L18, Abra - L15, Rattata - L15, 
Bulbasaur/Squirtle/Charmander - L17

With the right Pokemon, he shouldn't be very hard. For Pidgetto, use 
Pikachu at about level 18. Just pound him with Electric-type attacks to 
defeat him. For Abra...this guy is a joke! All he knows how to do is 
Teleport! So just use any Pokemon and you should be okay. For Rattata and 
the rest, use your best ones.
****************************************************************

Now that Gary is out of the way, continue to fight the trainers on Nugget 
Bridge. They aren't quite as hard as Gary, so you shouldn't have all that 
much trouble. Defeat the five trainers and you'll get a Nugget. Then you 
end up fighting a Rocket member. Defeat him to continue to Route 24 and 
25. 

-------------
Route 24 & 25
-------------
Pokemon:
#10 Caterpie 
#11 Metapod
#13 Weedle
#14 Kakuna
#16 Pidgey
#43 Oddish (Red)
#63 Abra
#69 Bellsprout (Blue)

Items:
TM 19
TM 45
S.S. Ticket

Abra is a good catch since he is the first Psychic-type Pokemon right 
now. When you run into him, throw a Poke Ball. Doing that might be odd, 
but does sometimes catch him! Once you get through the mass of trainers, 
you can visit Bill the Pokemaniac! When you first meet him, you find out 
he has been turned into a Pokemon. Check HM 01 in the "Important Info" 
section to see how you solve this. He'll give you the S.S. Ticket in 
return. Exit and go back inside and go on his PC. It contains pictures on 
Eevee, Vaporeon, Jolteon, and Flareon. This will add pics on them to your 
Pokedex. Now go back to Cerulean City.

-------------
Cerulean City
-------------
Items:
TM 28

The one house that was blocked by a guard is now open. Go inside to find 
out that a TM was stolen. Go out the back and fight the Rocket member. 
Beat him to get TM 28 which teaches a Pokemon "Dig". Keep going and head 
south to Route 5.

-------
Route 5
-------
Pokemon:
#16 Pidgey
#43 Oddish (Red)
#52 Meowth (Blue)
#56 Mankey (Red)
#69 Bellsprout (Blue)

In this area, you can find the Pokemon Daycare Center. Here, the man 
inside will take care of a Pokemon. While you are away, its levels build 
up. The downside is that you don't get to choose what attacks it can use. 
The new Pokemon to get is Mankey in the Red and Meowth in the Blue. Keep 
going south and enter the Underground Path to reach Route 6.

-------
Route 6
-------
Pokemon:
#16 Pidgey
#43 Oddish (Red)
#52 Meowth (Blue)
#56 Mankey (Red)
#69 Bellsprout (Blue)

Now exactly anything to do... Go south to reach Vermilion City.

--------------
Vermilion City
--------------
Items:
Old Rod
Bike Voucher

When you first get here, enter the house to the right of the Pokemon 
Center to get the Old Rod from the Fishing Guru. Once get that, enter the 
house that directly south the house you just went in. Here is where the 
Pokemon Fan Club is located. Talk to the president and listen to his 
stories to get a Bike Voucher (Good thing you get something for listening 
to his ever so slighty boring stories :). With the Bike Voucher, you can 
backtrack to Cerulean City to get a bike free. The bike will allow you to 
travel faster on land. If you enter the house right by the Fan Club, you 
can trade a Spearow for a Farfetch'd. Since you traded Pokemon, the 
Farfetch'd will gain about 1/3 more EXP. Before boarding the S.S Anne, 
you may want to pay a visit to Diglett's Cave and Route 11 to get new 
Pokemon. Go farther down the walkthrough for info on them. Also before 
boarding, build around four Pokemon to level 25 (There are lots of 
trainers on board!). Until you get the HM 01 inside, the ship won't leave 
the docks. Now let's take a tour...

---------
S.S. Anne
---------
Items:
HM 01
TM 08
TM 44
Great Ball
Ether
Max Ether
Rare Candy

If your Pokemon are tired and you didn't get HM 01 yet, you can leave and 
visit the Pokemon Center. Now's a good time to build your levels since 
there are loads of trainers on board. All the other items except the 
Great Ball are on the ground, but the ball can be found in the galley's 
trashcan. To reach Gary, go left from the start and go down the stairs. 
Then follow the hall until you meet up with Gary...

****************************************************************
TRAINER: Gary
POKEMON: Pidgeotto - L19, Raticate - L16, Kadabra - L18, 
Ivysaur/Wartortle/Charmeleon - L20

If you built up your levels, you should be fine. For Pidgetto, just use 
Pikachu. For the others, use your best Pokemon on them. 
****************************************************************

With Gary out of the way, go down the stairs that are where Gary came to 
the captain's room. To get the HM 01 from him, read the part on it in the 
"Important Info" section. Once you've got that done, leave the ship. 
Teach one of your Pokemon the Cut ability, and cut down the tree blocking 
your path to the Gym. Enter the Gym for a puzzle. Two trashcans in the 
room contain a switch. If you find a switch but the next can you looked 
in didn't have one, you have to start over. Since the switchs appear in 
random locations, I can't tell you where they are. What I would do is 
this: search the cans by rows or columns to narrow down where the 
switches are. Once you've found them, the door will open. Go through to 
fight the Gym leader...

****************************************************************
TRAINER: Lt. Surge
PRIZES: Thunder Badge & TM 24
POKEMON: Voltorb - L21, Pikachu - L18, Raichu - L24

If you have a Ground-type Pokemon, build its level to about 20 to make 
this fight easy. Use attacks like Rock Throw and Dig and each Pokemon 
will go down with about one hit. 
****************************************************************

Now with that done, head east and go into the cave.

--------------
Diglett's Cave
--------------
Pokemon:
#50 Diglett
#51 Dugtrio

You might have already been here to get Diglett, so if you didn't, get 
one. Go through this cave to reach an area near Viridian Forest.

---------------
Viridian Forest
---------------
Pokemon:
#122 Mr. Mime
 
Items:
HM 05
HP Up
Moon Stone

In the first house you find, you can trade an Abra for a Mr. Mime if you 
want. Cut down the tree, and head south to the next house and talk to one 
of Prof. Oak's aides. If you caught 10 or more kinds of Pokemon, he gives 
you HM 05 which contains Flash. Continue south to get items. Once you've 
got them, head back to Vermilion City. From there, go east to Route 11.

--------
Route 11
--------
Pokemon:
#21 Spearow
#23 Ekans (Red)
#27 Sandshrew (Blue)
#96 Drowzee

Items:
Itemfinder

Nothing much to do here. At the end of the route, search the tree that's 
by itself for an item. Enter the building, and upstairs is another one of 
Prof. Oak's aides. If you caught 30 or more kinds of Pokemon, he gives 
you an Itemfinder which allows you to find hidden items. Head to Cerulean 
City and head east to Route 9.

-------
Route 9
-------
Pokemon:
#19 Rattata
#21 Spearow
#23 Ekans (Red)
#27 Sandshrew (Blue)
#100 Voltorb

Items:
TM 30

Just capture Voltorb, get the TM and save at the Pokemon Center. You can 
teach one of your Pokemon Flash, but it's not required to get past Rock 
Tunnel. Once you're ready, head into the cave.

-----------
Rock Tunnel
-----------
Pokemon:
#41 Zubat
#66 Machop
#74 Geodude
#95 Onix

This cave is easy to go through if you use Flash! There is only one 
ladder to go through in each part. Capture Onix and Machop and make your 
way through the cave to come out at Route 10. At Route 10, search the 
tree for a Max Ether. Continue south to Lavender Town.

-------------
Lavender Town
-------------
This place contains Pokemon Tower, the graveyard for Pokemon. One of the 
town residents, Mr. Fuji, is missing, and ghosts are roaming around in 
the tower. You can't do anything to help out yet, so head west to Route 
8.

-------
Route 8
-------
Pokemon:
#16 Pidgey
#23 Ekans (Red)
#27 Sandshrew (Blue)
#37 Vulpix (Blue)
#52 Meowth (Blue) 
#56 Mankey (Red)
#58 Growlithe (Red)

The new Pokemon to get is Growlithe and Vulpix. Keep going west till you 
see two buildings. Enter the smaller one and go through an underground 
path that leads to Route 7.

-------
Route 7
-------
Pokemon:
#16 Pidgey
#23 Ekans (Red)
#27 Sandshrew (Blue)
#37 Vulpix (Blue)
#52 Meowth (Blue) 
#56 Mankey (Red)
#58 Growlithe (Red)

Just go west to Celadon City...

------------
Celadon City
------------
Pokemon:
#133 Eevee

This city contains the largest store in the game and Game Corner! To get 
Eevee, enter the back of the mansion and go up the building to get it. 
It's a good idea to buy some Stones at the store to evolve Pokemon and 
expand your collection. Now head to Game Corner, and press A at the 
poster at the back to find a hidden switch. The switch makes a secret 
passage appear to your right. Enter it to reach the basement...

--------------------
Game Corner Basement
--------------------
Items:
TM 02
TM 07 
TM 10
Super Potion
Hyper Potion
Escape Rope
Nugget
Rare Candy
HP Up
Lift Key
Silph Scope

As you can see, this place is loaded with items! I'll just tell where to 
go to get the Lift Key and Silph Scope. From where you entered, go down 
the stairs. Continue and go north from the Rocket guard and go down those 
stairs. Now you have to go through these moving tiles. This part is 
pretty easy, so figure it out for yourself. Once you navigate through 
them, go down the stairs. From there, go up and then left and fight the 
Rocket guard. He drops the Lift Key, so pick it up. With that, go back 
through the moving tiles room and go up the stairs. Now you have to go 
through more moving tiles! Again, this is easy enough to figure out how 
to get through. Once through that, go past the stairs and enter the 
elevator. Go up to the control panel and go the 4th Basement Floor. Exit 
the elevator and beat the Rocket guards near the door. Then go through to 
fight Giovanni, the head of Team Rocket...

****************************************************************
TRAINER: Giovanni
POKEMON: Onix - L25, Rhyhorn - L24, Kangaskhan - L29

This guy is quite easy if you use a Water-type Pokemon at about L25. Onix 
and Rhyhorn will go down with a couple Water-type attacks, but Kangaskhan 
will be a bit harder. 
****************************************************************

Once you beat Giovanni, you get the Silph Scope! Now's the time to go 
into the Celadon Gym to fight for another Badge...

****************************************************************
TRAINER: Erika
PRIZES: Rainbow Badge & TM 21
POKEMON: Victreebel - L29, Tangela - L24, Vileplume - L29

For this fight, use a Fire-type Pokemon at about L26. Then just burn each 
one out a couple Fire-type attacks.
****************************************************************

Now with that done, head to the Pokemon Tower in Lavender Town.

-------------
Pokemon Tower
-------------
Pokemon:
#92 Gastly
#93 Haunter
#104 Cubone

Items:
Elixier
Awakening
Escape Rope
Nugget
Rare Candy
HP Up
X Accuracy
Poke Flute

With the Silph Scope in hand, you can identify the Ghosts inside! Make 
sure you do capture a Ghost-type Pokemon because a good bit of attacks do 
not hit them. Once on the 2nd Floor, you'll run into Gary...

****************************************************************
TRAINER: Gary
POKEMON: Pidgeotto - L25, Growlithe - L23, Exeggcute - L22, Kadabra - 
L20, Wartortle/Charmeleon/Ivysaur - 25

Since you got the Rainbow Badge, build up about 4 Pokemons' levels to 
about 25 for an easy fight. For Pidgetto, use the usual Electric-type 
Pokemon. When fighting Growlithe, put out its fire with Water-type 
attacks. For Exeggcute, burn it with Fire-type attacks. For the rest, 
just use your best ones.
****************************************************************

Head to the 3rd and you'll find some people which evil spirits have 
"taken" over them. You can free them of the evil spirits, but it's not 
required to do so. Keep going up until you reach the 5th Floor. On that 
floor, someone has made you a "healing tile" to heal your Pokemon. When 
you try to go up the stairs on the 6th Floor, you will fight a L30 
Marowak. When you beat Cubone's Mother, her spirit will lay to 
rest...allowing you to go on. On the final floor, there will be some 
Rocket guards around. Defeat them, and talk to Mr. Fuji. Then you will 
appear back at house. Talk to him again to get the Poke Flute. Always 
carry this with you, for it will wake up sleeping Pokemon. Head back to 
Celadon City and visit the big Poke Mart. Go to the top floor with the 
vending machines. Buy some Fresh Water. Remember those guards who said 
that they were thirsty? Talk to the guard and give him the water. He then 
shares with the other gaurds so you can pass through to Saffron City. But 
before you want to go Saffron City, you may want to get HM 02 which 
teaches Fly. Check the "Important Info" section to find out how.

------------
Saffron City
------------
Pokemon:
#106 Hitmonlee or
#107 Hitmonchan

This is one of the more bigger places in the game. Before you enter Silph 
Co., you can go to the Fighting Dojo Gym to get a Pokemon that can't be 
found anywhere else. Enter the Gym and you can skip three of the Trainers 
by going around them. Your Psychic-type Pokemon will be needed to easily 
overcome the Fighting-type. To get the rare Pokemon, talk to the leader 
at the back to enter a fight...

****************************************************************
TRAINER: Blackbelt
POKEMON: Hitmonlee - L37, Hitmonchan - L37

For an easy victory, use any Psychic-type Pokemon. Otherwise, just use 
some normal attacks that do decent damage such as Slash and Scratch. The 
leader also tends to use X Attack on his Pokemon.  
****************************************************************

Once you win, the Karate Master will allow to choose a Hitmonlee or a 
Hitmonchan. Both are good fighters, so it doesn't really matter which one 
you choose. With that done, head to Silph Co.

This place is can be easily completed by doing the basic things. When you 
enter, head to the elevator and go the 5th Floor. On this floor, you can 
find the Card Key at the small hallway part with a Rocket guard. Get the 
key and go to the 3rd Floor. From the room with the open door, go left 
and open the first door. Step on the teleporter, and you'll appear and 
enter the room with Gary...

****************************************************************
TRAINER: Gary
POKEMON: Pidgeot - L37, Growlithe - L38, Exeggcute - L35, Alakazam - L35, 
Blastoise/Charizard/Venusaur - L40

If you're not prepared, this will be a tough fight. You know the drill 
from the last fight with Gary. For Pidgeot, use the Electric-type and on 
Growlithe, use the Water-type. Burn Exeggcute with the Fire-type. For the 
rest, just battle it out with your best.
****************************************************************

Now that Gary is out of the way, talk to the Silph Co. worker to get 
Lapras. Continue down and step on the teleporter. Now you'll appear on 
the 11th Floor. Go down, beat the Rocket guard and open the door for a 
fight with Giovanni...

****************************************************************
TRAINER: Giovanni
POKEMON: Nidorino - L37, Kangaskhan - L35, Rhyhorn - L37, Nidoqueen - L41

Like the last Giovanni fight, use any Water-type Pokemon. That's really 
just about it...
****************************************************************

Once you defeat him, talk to the Silph Co. president to get the Master 
Ball, a kind of Poke Ball that can catch any Pokemon regardless of its 
HP! Now that you put Team Rocket out of the way, head to the Gym. This 
one has yet another puzzle, but with using teleporters. Step on the first 
teleporter, then go up to another teleporter. Then step on the lower-left 
teleporter. Now go to the right and step on the teleporter. Now again, 
step on the lower-left teleporter and you'll end up at Sabrina...

****************************************************************
TRAINER: Sabrina
PRIZES: Marsh Badge & TM 46
POKEMON: Kadabra - L38, Mr. Mime - L37, Venomoth - L38, Alakazam - L43

Use you best Pokemon, they should be around L39, against them. Use 
decent-damaging attacks such as Slash and Scratch.
****************************************************************

With all that done, now's a good time to start to expand your Pokemon 
collection. But to fish all the good Pokemon you are going to need the 
Super Rod at Route 12. Head south from Lavender Town or east from 
Vermilion to reach it...

--------
Route 12
--------
Pokemon:
#16 Pidgey
#43 Oddish (Red)
#44 Gloom (Red)
#48 Venonat (Red)
#69 Bellsprout (Blue)
#70 Weepinbell (Blue)
#143 Snorlax

Items:   
TM 16
Super Rod

When you encounter the sleeping Snorlax, use the Poke Flute to wake him 
up. It will then attack you. Capturing the L30 Snorlax is a piece of cake 
compared to getting the mythical birds! When he uses "Rest", wear 'em 
down and toss Great Balls at him. Once that's done, keep going south to 
reach a house. Go inside and talk to the Fishing Guru for a Super Rod. 
Now you start catching loads of water Pokemon! Now it's time to head to 
Fuchsia City, but there is two ways to reaching it: Routes 13, 14, & 15 
or Routes 16, 17 & 18...

-------------------
Routes 13, 14, & 15
-------------------
Pokemon:
#16 Pidgey
#17 Pidgetto
#43 Oddish
#44 Gloom
#48 Venonat
#69 Bellsprout
#70 Weepinbell
#132 Ditto

Items:
TM 20
EXP. All

Ditto can a great Pokemon to use, as it allows you to change into the 
enemy's Pokemon. But the problem is that you only get 5 PP for any and 
every move! Ditto is also a hard Pokemon to catch. Keep going through 
until you reach one of those towers. Inside is another of Prof. Oak's 
Aides. If you've caught 50 or more Pokemon, he gives an EXP. All. Keep 
going to reach Fuchsia City.

-------------------
Routes 16, 17, & 18
-------------------
Pokemon:
#19 Ratta
#20 Raticate
#21 Spearow
#22 Fearow
#84 Doduo
#143 Snorlax

Items:
HM 02

This place also has Snorlax in it. Use the Poke Flute to wake him up, 
then defeat or capture it. Since place is mainly a steep hill, use your 
Bicycle to travel down easier. You can find HM 02 here, check the 
Important Info to see how. Once you reach the end, go east to reach 
Fuchsia City.

------------
Fuchsia City
------------ 
Items:
Good Rod

Here is where Safari Zone is located! You can also get HM 04 here if you 
can find the Warden's Gold Teeth. Read the "Important Info" section to 
see how. Visit the house beside the Warden's to see the Fishing Guru. 
Talk to him to get the Good Rod. Enter the Gym where you can find Koga. 
Before you can fight him, you must move around the Gym where there are 
hidden walls. Along the way you'll end up runnning into Trainers. Go 
through that, talk to Koga to enter the fight...

****************************************************************
TRAINER: Koga
PRIZES: Soul Badge & TM 06
POKEMON: Koffing - L37, Muk - L39, Koffing - L37, Weezing - L43

This Gym Leader uses Poison-type Pokemon, so buy some Antidotes. Use 
Ground-type Pokemon at about L40 for an easy win. If you use Poison-type 
Pokemon, you won't have to worry about being poisoned!
****************************************************************

With that done, you can head to Safari Zone to increase your Pokemon 
collection. Now the next stop is Cinnabar Island...

---------------
Cinnabar Island
---------------
To reach this place, you must first get HM 03 which has Surf. Then go to 
Pallet Town, and Surf down until you reach it. Here at Cinnabar Island, 
you can ressurect Pokemon with the Fossils. To do so, go to the Pokemon 
Lab, enter the third room with give your Fossil to the scientist. Exit 
the Lab, enter and talk to him to get the Pokemon. Here is what you can 
get:

Old Amber = #142 Aerodactyl
Helix Fossil = #138 Omanyte
Dome Fossil = #140 Kabuto

If you try to enter the Cinnabar Gym, you'll find out that the door is 
locked. You need to enter the Pokemon Mansion and find the Secret Key. 
Before you enter, try to build up a couple Water- or Rock-type Pokemon to 
about L38. Also bring along a Pokemon that has the Dig move. 

---------------
Pokemon Mansion
---------------
Pokemon:
#37 Vulpix (Blue)
#58 Growlithe (Red)
#77 Ponyta
#88 Grimer
#89 Muk
#109 Koffing
#110 Weezing
#126 Magmar (Blue)

Items:
TM 14
TM 22
Secret Key
Max Potion
Full Restore
Escape Rope
Rare Candy
Iron 
Carbos
Calcium

This is a bit confusing because of the switches. Around the building, you 
can find notes that tell about the mansion and Pokemon. When you enter, 
go up and enter the stairs. On the 2nd Floor, activate the switch nearby 
on the statue. Then enter the room that's north of you. Then go up the 
stairs. From there, there is another statue with a switch. Hit that and 
go into the lower room. Leap off the lower-left ledge. You'll land on the 
1st Floor. In that room, there is another flight of stairs. Go down them 
to enter the basement. In the room to your left, activate the switch 
there and enter the hallway north of the stairs you went up. Keep going 
through to find the Secret Key at the end. Use Dig to exit the building. 

With the key in hand, you can now open the Gym. In the Gym, you must beat 
Trainers in order for the doors to open. At the end, talk to Blaine for 
the fight...

****************************************************************
TRAINER: Blaine
PRIZES: Volcano Badge & TM 38
POKEMON: Growlithe - L42, Ponyta - L40, Rapidash - L42, Arcanine - L47

Use L40+ Ground- or Water-type Pokemon to make this fight a sinch. 
Attacks such as Bubblebeam, Earthquake, and Dig prove to be quite 
effective against beating him.
****************************************************************

With Blaine out of the way, you have one more Gym Leader to beat. Surf or 
Fly back to Pallet Town and go to Viridian City.

-------------
Viridian City
------------- 
Remember when you first went here and the Gym was locked? Now it's open! 
Go inside and navigate through the moving tiles. Talk to the final Gym 
Leader, Giovanni...

****************************************************************
TRAINER: Giovanni
PRIZES: Earth Badge & TM 27
POKEMON: Rhyhorn - L45, Dugtrio - L42, Nidoqueen - L44, Nidoking - L45, 
Rhydon - L50

Like the other couple fights with Giovanni, use Water-type Pokemon at 
about L45. You should be able to take him out pretty easily with Water-
type attacks.
****************************************************************

With all of the Gym Leaders defeated, you must now head to the Elite 
Four. Go west of Viridian and you'll encounter Gary...

****************************************************************
TRAINER: Gary
POKEMON: Pidgeot - L47, Rhyhorn - L45, Growlithe - L45, Exeggcute - L47, 
Alakazam - L50, Blastoise/Charizard/Venusaur - L53

This battle isn't much different from the last couple battles with Gary. 
Use Electric on Pidgeot, Water will take down Rhyhorn and Growlithe 
easily. For the rest, use your best!
****************************************************************

Continue on to enter the building that leads to the Pokemon League HQ...

#21 Spearow
#22 Fearow
#23 Ekans
#24 Arbok
#27 Sandshrew
#28 Sandslash

In order to get past all the guards, you must collect all eight Badges. 
You also need Surf to get past the water. Get through all this to enter 
Victory Road.

TM 47
Max Revive
Full Heal
Rare Candy
Guard Spec.

This place contains the mythical fire bird, Moltres. In order for you to 
move through this place, you need Strength. The main to do is to move the 
boulders onto the switches so you can reach another area. This place 
isn't that confusing, but in one spot there is a hole in which you push 
the boulder in it. It's kinda hard to see it on the Gameboy screen. 
Moltres will be a difficult one to catch. Wear him down with Electric- or 
Water-type attacks and put him to sleep. Then use Ultra Balls on him. 
Once you reach the exit, head north to Indigo Plateau.

--------------
Inidgo Plateau
--------------
This place is just a Poke Mart and a Pokemon Center in one. Once you're 
prepared for the Elite Four, go down the stairs. Check the "Elite Four" 
part in the Important Info section on beating them. Once they're done 
for, you can now enter the cave near Cerulean City, the Unknown Dungeon. 
You can also collect the other Legendary Birds, but it's optional.

Power Plant

Pokemon:
#25 Pikachu
#26 Raichu (Blue)

#125 Electabuzz (Red)
#145 Zapdos

Items:
TM 25
TM 33
Rare Candy
Carbos
HP Up

To reach the Power Plant, go east of Cerulean City. When you see the 
water near the entrance to Rock Tunnel, Surf down it and you'll end up by 
it. Inside the plant, there are several Poke Balls that are actually 
Voltorbs instead of items. At the end of this place is Zapdos. Get his 
energy down as far as you can, put him to sleep and throw Ultra Balls at 
him. With Zapdos captured, head to Seafoam Islands.

---------------
Seafoam Islands

Pokemon:

#87 Dewgong
#90 Shellder
#98 Krabby
#99 Kingler
#116 Horsea
#120 Staryu
#144 Articuno

To reach this place, Surf down from Fuchsia City. Continue on until you 
reach the islands. Here you will you need to move more boulders, so you 
need Strength. All you need to do is to move the boulders down the holes 
until they land in the water. Then on the 3rd Basement Floor, push those 
boulders there into the holes so they land in the water. Now you can 
reach Articuno! Repeat the same thing that you did on Zapdos to get him. 
Now head to Cerulean City. Go north and Surf down until you reach a cave 
entrance.

#132 Ditto
#150 Mewtwo

Items:
Max Revive
Max Elixier
Full Restore x2
Ultra Ball x2
PP Up
Nugget

Make sure you prepared for the Pokemon here, they are ALL at least L50! 
Since these Pokemon have high levels, you can capture a good team to use. 
This is also the best place to build up the levels of Pokemon since you 
get about 1,000 EXP after each fight. This place isn't very confusing, so 
finding Mewtwo isn't too hard. When you do, use the Master Ball. If you 
did use it, repeat what you did to the others.

Now you've completed Pokemon! Good luck on catching all 150!

10) CODES / TIPS
================
WARNING NOTE: I must warn you about using the codes for Pokemon! Some of 
the codes may screw up your saved game while others may mess up the 
"Pokemon League Site" on the PC. So far, no has said to me that the codes 
have screwed their Pokemon GamePak horribly. The side effects can be 
fixed by starting a new saved game.

Clone Pokemon
By: bvpage (RHS Linux User)

To begin, you must have two Gameboys linked. Gameboy A has the Pokemon to 
be cloned (I cloned Mewtwo, but any one will work), and Gameboy B will 
have the Pokemon to be erased because they will get the cloned Pokemon (a 
weak Pokemon like Magikarp will do. They're easy to catch and worthless 
unless evolved). Gameboy A will be the first to enter the Cable Club, and 
the first to trade or this code will not work. Gameboy A will trade the 
good Pokemon, and Gameboy B will trade the bad one. After Gameboy A gets 
the bad Pokemon the screen will say "waiting". Gameboy A will turn off 
the Gameboy the second "waiting" clears off the screen. Then Gameboy B's 
screen will say "trade complete". The screen won't clear, so you'll have 
to turn the Gameboy off. Then, restart the game and you'll have a cloned 
Pokemon! The weak Pokemon will have disappeared because it never really 
traded (or didn't finish trading).

NOTE: This may cause your saved game to screw up!

Fight Land Pokemon On Water

To fight land Pokemon on water, go to the eastern side of Seafoam 
Islands. Surf up and down along the eastern coat to do that. The Pokemon 
that you fight are from the area you last visited. This even works with 
Safari Zone!

Catch Pokemon Better #1
By: BfloPat

To help increase your chances of catching a Pokemon, press B + Down when 
you use a Poke Ball or press B + Up when you use an Ultra Ball. 

Pokemon Daycare Experience
By: RazzDude

Here is much experience your Pokemon can earn when they are at the 
Pokemon Daycare Center. For every step Ash takes, that Pokemon gets one 
experience point.

Get Mew - #1 
By: SSJxVejito

This code only works for the Japanese Version and is only a rumor and not 
confirmed.
Go to the Pokemon Mansion, and inside is a person who will give you #151 
Mew. If you try to do it in the American version, you will not get it but 
you'll get something else.

Pokemon #000 - MissingNo
By: dbayles (Daniel Bayles)

I've finished the game, and just about had all 150 Pok‚mon. I was 
wandering around Cinnabar Island, and went into the lab, where you get 
your Kabuto/Omanyte, and/or Aerodactyl. Out of sheer boredom, I traded a 
Ponyta for a Seel. Then I went outside, and surfed along the edge of the 
island where the square is half land, half water. A random battle came 
up. It took longer to load, and when it did, a random mess of hex code 
was my opponent. "MISSINGNO" was his name, and was displayed as Pokemon 
#000, and is at level 80. The only way to catch him is to put him to 
sleep, and use a Pokemon with Agility to throw Ultra Balls, as any attack 
kills it. When you catch him, it does not add new Pok‚dex info.  (DO NOT 
SAVE THE GAME!) Take him into battle a few times if you wish, but DO NOT 
SAVE! When your battle screen pops up, your character will be distorted. 
MISSINGNO has 3 attacks, Water Gun, Sky Attack, and I didn't look at the 
other one (My Note: I've heard that his third attack was Water Gun, he 
has the move twice.). Once you've looked him over, turn off the GameBoy 
without saving, as keeping him can result in erasing your save, and 
possibly permanently screwing up your cartridge. He's actually a glitch, 
so he doesn't count as a Pokemon! Be safe, don't save.

Catch Pokemon Better #2
By: DAW1230

Here's another easy to catch Pokemon! When you throw any type of Poke 
Ball, hold A and B for an easy catch.

Get Mew - #2 (Unconfirmed)
By: Specter (James Dixon)

This code works on both Red and Blue Versions. After capturing Mewtwo you 
can capture Mew in the same cave. He can be anywhere inside the Unknown 
Dungeon. Mew will be disguised as another Pokemon.(Particuly another 
Psychic-type Pokemon) You can tell if it is Mew or not by the name it 
says on the top of the battle screen. The range of Level will vary, and 
you only have ONE chance at capturing it. Be prepared for a long battle!

Stat Evolution Tip
By: lunatikk_1

The earlier that you evolve a Pokemon, the higher the two of their four 
stats will be when they gain a Level than when you don't evolve them. 
Here is how that works, I'll use Exeggutor as an example (I'm not sure if 
what I'm about to say about his 
stats are completely true, but close enough). Say as an Exeggcute his 
Attack goes up by 1 point for every Level-Up. Whereas Exeggutor's Attack 
will go up 3 points per Level-Up. It accumulates more Attack points and 
will make him stronger. I KNOW Exeggutor's Attack and Special develop 
faster than Exeggcute's. It's a perfect pay off. If you keep Exeggcute 
the way he is 
he'll learn alot of moves, but evolve him early and you'll get really 
high stats. What 2 areas develop faster differs Pokemon to Pokemon. I've 
checked this out with others too (Arcanine, Starmie, Raichu), and it 
stays consistent.

Fight Pokemon At L100+

Probably another glitch, but you can actually catch Pokemon that their 
Level is higher than 100! Here's how to do it:
1. Go to the Old Man, who blocked you off earlier in the game, in 
Viridian City.
2. Talk to him, and when he asks if you're in a hurry, say no.
3. Once he's done talking to you, Fly to Cinnabar Island without going to 
any places where you can fight Pokemon.
4. Surf up and down the right edge of the island, and when you enter a 
Pokemon fight, you can find a Pokemon whose Level is 100+! 

But you may not always find Pokemon with 100+ Level because this trick 
works sort of like the one at Seamfoam Islands. The stats of the Pokemon 
are like they would be at that level. For Golduck, which was at L152, all 
of his stats are 260+! 

NOTE: The major downside of this trick is that if the Pokemon gets  any 
EXP (Even 1 point), its Level will go back down to L100 which can be good 
anyways. You can also find Missingno here, but he is even more glitched 
when you try to get him than with other codes. This trick works best if 
you use the Pokemon in the Cable Club since you can't gain any EXP when 
you fight a friend. This can also mess up your Pokemon Hall of Fame on 
the PC.

Infinite Items/Money
By: haashome

When you go into a battle with a MissingNo., the 6th Item in your "ITEM" 
menu will become maxed out. So, you can have 1 Master Ball in the 6th 
Item Slot, go into a battle with a MissingNo., and then you have 100+ 
Master Balls! You can do this unlimited times and sell the Items for 
major money!
NOTE: This code will work regardless if you catch MissingNo. or not.

Raise Pokemons' Level after L100+
By: haashome

You have to use the "Fight Pokemon Over L100+" code first, then get into 
a battle with a Pokemon over L100. Then once you have captured a Pokemon 
thats over L100, use the "Infinite Items" cheat to get 100+ Rare Candies, 
and then feed it TONS of Rare Candies! You should save the game often, 
though, because after a certain Level (after L255 for my MissingNo.) It 
will go all the way back to L0!

=================================
11) GAMESHARK / GAME GENIE CODES
=================================

----------------
Gameshark Codes:
----------------
(This codes are from the official Gameshark website, www.gameshark.com)

WARNING:
DO NOT use theses codes if you have a saved game. These codes will erase 
an already existing saved game!

Infinite HP (Battle) = 01ff16d0
No Random Battles = 01033cd1
Infinite Money = 019947d3 + 019948d3 + 019949d3

(The following codes were submitted by: Lord_Jordus)

01XX1FD3 - Infinite amount of items the first slot. XX is any amount. If 
you move an item to the first slot, you will have XX of the item you 
replaced.
0199A4D5 + 0199A5D5 = Infinite Coins
01FF15D0 + 01FF16D0 = Highest infinite HP, but the HP bar will extend 
around the screen.
010116D0 = Best infinite HP (Even though you have only one HP.)
016447DA = Infinite Safari Balls
01F00ED7 = Infinite Safari Zone time
01011ED3 = First item on your items list becomes the Master Ball! If you 
switch the first item to something else, however, both items will become 
Master Balls.
01701FD0 = In battle, the skill on the bottom is Metronome! It makes your 
Pokemon do a random move. Even the ones it doesn't know! This doesn't 
affect your Pokemon in any way.

Item Codes:
Buy anything you want if you have the money. These codes work in any Poke 
Mart. See list at end of what you can get.

01XX7CCF = 1st Slot
01XX7DCF = 2nd Slot
01XX7ECF = 3rd Slot

Some numbers above 64 will crash the game if you try to use the items 
that aren't really there. Missing numbers are items you could get early, 
but won't always help you if you do. They might cause problems with the 
game.

Pick Any Pokemon Codes:
01XX1ED1 - Pick your starting Pokemon with this code change the XX's to a 
number from the list.

Pick your starting Pokemon from the 3 Balls at the start of the
game. Pick Pokemon from list. All Balls will have the same one.
It will ask you if you want the type of Pokemon that is normally
there but you will get what you picked. After you get the Pokemon make 
sure you save the game and remove the code.
Note: Some Pokemon will not be playable!

01XXD8CF - Pick the Pokemon you want to fight and capture anytime. Change 
the XX's to a number from the list. This code will cause you to always 
fight the same Pokemon. Thus you will be able to capture it. Sometimes 
the picture of the Pokemon will be messed up, but you can still get it 
without problems later on. Use my store codes to get some Master Balls 
from any Poke Mart. (Master Balls cost 0 and always catch even if you 
don't weaken the Pokemon.)

Enter the code, and you will fight the Pokemon in the grass west of 
Cerulean City. This is the only area the code works!

===================
12) POKEMON RUMORS
===================
Remember that these rumors are FALSE, so don't e-mail me saying they're 
true! If you have any other Pokemon rumors, e-mail me!

Hidden Pokemon - Mew #1:
Probably the most well-known rumor in Pokemon! Before you get the HM 01, 
you must trade with a friend for Pokemon with the Surf, Cut, and Strength 
ability. Then use the Cut ability to go further into the game to get the 
Badges so you can use the moves. Now go to the S.S. Anne and Surf to the 
right to find a truck. Move the truck with Strength to find Mew in a Poke 
Ball under it. 
My Note: There is a truck by the S.S. Anne, but Strength does not move it 
even if you have 150 Pokemon!

Hidden Pokemon - Flareth:
By: SMDR35
First get all 150 pokemon, and then swim around the Unknown Dungeon. Keep 
pressing A until you find a note and go to the girl who says I want a 
drink, and talk to her 100 times.  She will then say leave me alone and 
give you Flareth.

Hidden Pokemon - Pikablu:
By: ArchonWarp
Here is how to get the Pokegod Pikablu that is going to be in the Gold 
and Silver Versions in the Red and Blue Versions. Here goes: first you 
have to get Eevee, Jolteon, Flareon, and Vaporeon and take them and only 
them with you. Then you go to Bill's house (A.K.A Sea Cottage) and look 
at his Pokemon on his PC at least 50 times each. When you next talk to 
him he'll say,"Wow!" or something like that and give you the Pikablu.

Hidden Pokemon - Mew #2:
By: Spun101
First, you need to get a Nidoking to L100. Then go to Celadon City and 
find a Team Rocket member and talk to him. He will ask you if he could 
have the Nidoking. If you give it to him he will give you a set of Keys. 
You use the Keys to turn the truck by the S.S. Anne on and move it. A 
Poke Ball should be there and that's where you get Mew.
